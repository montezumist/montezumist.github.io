### Details
{:.no_toc}
* Prep time: 20 minutes
* Cook time: 30 minutes
* Servings: 5-6

### Ingredients
* 4 links of chicken sausage
* 1 bag of frozen peas
* 1 bunch of purple carrots
* 2 tomatoes
* 1/2 red onion
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 3/4 cup of water
* garlic powder, a pinch of cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to season

### Method
0. Chop the carrots into medium slices. Bring water to a boil and blanch the purple carrots for about 10 minutes until mostly cooked. Drain and reserve.

1. In another saucepan, bring water to a boil and cook the peas for about 6 to 7 minutes until mostly cooked through. Drain and reserve. 

2. Chop the tomatoes and onion into dice. 

3. While the carrots and peas are cooking, put the oil in a large pot and brown the sausages for about 5 minutes on all sides. Once browned, take the sausage out and chop them into one-inch pieces. Put them back into the pot and add the diced onion. Cook until the onion is translucent - about 3 minutes - and add the tomatoes. Cook the mixture until the tomatoes have formed a sauce, about 6 to 10 minutes. Season with garlic powder, salt, cayenne and black pepper.

4. Once the tomato sauce is ready, mix in the cooked carrots and peas and coat them well with the tomato sauce. Add water and simmer the sauce and veggies for 10 to 15 minutes. Serve warm with rice.
