### Ingredients
* 1 cup risotto rice (or other rice e.g. jasmine)

1. Chop shallots and saute into olive oil in the pressure cooker unti translucent. Chop mushrooms and add to the cooked shallots. Cut the ham into small cubes and add to the mushrooms. Cook the mushrooms and ham for about 5 minutes while stirring occasionally.

2. Add the rice to the mushrooms and make sure to coat the rice with the olive oil. Add soy sauce, coat rice again, and let it cook for a minute or two.

3. Add the wine and stir until most of the wine evaporates. Slice the courgettes into half-moons and add to the rice mixture, making sure to coat the courgettes with the sauce. Add the broth.

4. Close the pressure cooker and bring it to pressure. Once at high pressure, lower the stove temperature, and let the risotto cook for 7 minutes.

5. Once the 7 minutes are up, slowly release the pressure using the pressure valve. Serve the risotto with parmesan and chopped parsley.
