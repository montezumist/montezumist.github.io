Here is my CV.
-------------
If I use hyphens, then the text before that becomes a heading. 
How does one draw a line in markdown?

Test 2 using underscores:
________________________
here is some text after the underscores

Test 3 using asterisks:
***********************

and some more text

Test 4 with dashes and spaces:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
blah blah blah
