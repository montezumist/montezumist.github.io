- You are at the airport about to go on a trip and you have a ticket for each one of your flights. However, you drop all your tickets. So given your tickets on the ground, find your original itinerary.
- You have a sidewalk of length $$N$$. It's raining - each time it rains, you are given a range of where on the sidewalk rain has fallen. Ring a bell when all the sidewalk is wet.
- You have a list of integers. Sort them such that $$ n_1 < n_2 > n_3 < n_4 > $$...
- You have a square room with mirrors squattered at known location. Given the location of where light enters the room, find out where the light exits the room.
- Given a list of words, find all the possible word squares that can be formed.
For example: if you have the list ['BEAR', 'PEAR, 'PEAS', 'ASDA', 'EAST', 'WEST', 'STAR', 'EASE', 'SEAL'], a possible word square is
```
PEAS
EAST
ASDA
STAR
```
